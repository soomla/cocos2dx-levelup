# cocos2dx-levelup

<!-- updates when you have any -->
<!-- end updates -->

cocos2dx-levelup is a library built for easily modeling game structure and user progression, and allows rapid protoyping using a standard and simplified model.  It acts as sort of a 'blueprint' for the game, modeling worlds/levels, gates to levels, missions and rewards that can be completed and achieved.  All this is backed by SOOMLA's core tools, and can be easily integrated with more SOOMLA modules, like cocos2dx-store for IAP, or cocos2dx-profile for social related functions.

cocos2dx-levelup is the implementation of the LevelUp module for the Cocos2d-x framework, using the C++ flavour.

## Model Overview

<!-- attach UML style simple diagram -->


Generally, the SOOMLA sources contain detailed documentation on the different entities and how to use them, but here's a quick glance:

![Model Overview](http://know.soom.la/img/tutorial_img/soomla_diagrams/levelup.png)

### World / Level

A _Level_ is pretty clear, and most games have them.
A simple example is an Angry Birds single level, where you need to knock out all the pigs.
It measures specific things, such as duration it takes to complete, and can be started and ended.

A _World_ is a more general concept than a Level (a Level **Is-a** World), and can have `innerWorlds` to create hierarchies. Another example from Angry Birds is level pages and episodes, which contain the actual levels.

The _Initial World_ is a container world for all worlds and levels in the game. We use the _Initial World_ to intialize the LevelUp module.

### Score

A _Score_ is something which can be accumulated or measured within a _World_ (or _Level_ of course).
It can be incremented or decremented based on user actions, and recorded at the completion of the _World / Level_.

This, in turn, can later be applied to high scores or best times, or treated as collectibles that can be awarded upon completion.

### Gate

A _Gate_ is a closed portal from one _World_ to the next. It can be unlocked in many different ways (according to _Gate_ type), and can also be combined into a _GatesList_ to build more complex _Gates_.

### Mission/Challenge

A _Mission_ is a single task a player can complete in a game, usually for a _Reward_.

A _Challenge_ is a set of _Missions_ that need to be completed, so it's a big _Mission_ built out of several smaller _Missions_.

### Reward

A _Reward_ is some kind of perk or status a player can achieve in the game.
This can be either a badge, a virtual item from the game's economy (sword, coins etc.) or anything you can think of, really (unlocking game content or levels comes to mind).

## Getting Started (With pre-built libraries - RECOMMENDED)

*If you want to develop with sources, refer to the [Working with sources](#working-with-sources) section below*.

> NOTE: LevelUp depends on SOOMLA's other modules: Core, Store, and Profile. This document assumes that you are new to SOOMLA and have not worked with any of the other SOOMLA modules. If this is not the case, and you already *have* some or all of the other modules, please follow these directions only for the modules you are missing and of course, for the **LevelUp** module.

1. If you didn't already, clone the Cocos2d-x framework from [here](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x), or download it from the [Cocos2d-x website](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/download). Make sure the version you clone is supported by cocos2dx-levelup (the tag is the version).

1. Clone [soomla-cocos2dx-core](https://github.com/soomla/soomla-cocos2dx-core), [cocos2dx-store](https://github.com/soomla/cocos2dx-store), [cocos2dx-profile](https://github.com/soomla/cocos2dx-profile), and **cocos2dx-levelup** into the `extensions` directory located at the root of your Cocos2d-x framework:

    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:soomla/soomla-cocos2dx-core.git extensions/soomla-cocos2dx-core

    $ git clone git@github.com:soomla/cocos2dx-store.git extensions/cocos2dx-store

    $ git clone git@github.com:soomla/cocos2dx-profile.git extensions/cocos2dx-profile

    $ git clone git@github.com:soomla/cocos2dx-levelup.git extensions/cocos2dx-levelup
    ```

1. We use a [fork](https://github.com/soomla/jansson) of the jansson library for JSON parsing, clone our fork into the `external` directory at the root of your framework:

    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:soomla/jansson.git external/jansson
    ```

1. Make sure to include the `Cocos2dxLevelUp.h` header whenever you use any of the **cocos2dx-levelup** functions:

    ```cpp
    #include "Cocos2dxLevelUp.h"
    ```
1. Add an instance of your event handler to `CCLevelUpEventDispatcher` before `CCSoomlaLevelUp` initialization:

    ```cpp
    soomla::CCLevelUpEventDispatcher::getInstance()->addEventHandler(handler);
    ```

1. Initialize `CCSoomla`, `CCSoomlaStore`, `CCSoomlaProfile`, and `CCSoomlaLevelUp` with the class you just created, a `customSecret` and other params:

	```cpp
  soomla::CCSoomla::initialize("customSecret");

	__Dictionary *storeParams = __Dictionary::create();
	storeParams->setObject(__String::create("ExamplePublicKey"), "androidPublicKey");
  soomla::CCSoomlaStore::initialize(assets, storeParams);

  __Dictionary *profileParams = __Dictionary::create();
	soomla::CCSoomlaProfile::initialize(profileParams);

	// initialWorld - should be created here and contain all worlds and levels of the game
	// rewards - should contain a list of all rewards that are given through LevelUp
	soomla::CCSoomlaLevelUp::getInstance()->initialize(initialWorld, rewards);

	```
	- NOTE: *Custom Secret* - is an encryption secret you provide that will be used to secure your data. Choose this secret wisely, you can't change it after you launch your game!
	> Initialize `CCSoomlaLevelUp` ONLY ONCE when your application loads.

1. You'll need to subscribe to levelup events to get notified about Level-Up related events. refer to the [Event Handling](#event-handling) section for more information.

**The next steps are different according to which platform you're using.**

####**Instructions for iOS**

In your XCode project, perform the following steps:

1. Add `jansson` (**external/jansson/**) to your project (just add it as a source folder, make sure to check "create group").

1. For each of the following XCode projects:
	- `Cocos2dXCore.xcodeproj` (**extensions/soomla-cocos2dx-core/**).  
	- `Cocos2dXStore.xcodeproj` (**extensions/cocos2dx-store/**).
	- `Cocos2dXProfile.xcodeproj` (**extensions/soomla-cocos2dx-profile/**).  
	- `Cocos2dXLevelUp.xcodeproj` (**extensions/cocos2dx-levelup/**).

	Perform the following:
		- Drag the project into your project
		- Add its targets to your **Build Phases->Target Dependencies**
		- Add the Products (\*.a) of the project to **Build Phases->Link Binary With Libraries**.

1. Add the following directories to **Build Settings->Header Search Paths** (with `recursive` option):
> This article assumes you have a `cocos2d` folder under your project folder and which either contains the Cocos2d-x framework, or links to to its root folder

 - `$(SRCROOT)/../cocos2d/extensions/soomla-cocos2dx-core/Soomla`
 - `$(SRCROOT)/../cocos2d/extensions/soomla-cocos2dx-core/build/ios/headers`
 - `$(SRCROOT)/../cocos2d/extensions/cocos2dx-store/Soomla`
 - `$(SRCROOT)/../cocos2d/extensions/cocos2dx-profile/Soomla`
 - `$(SRCROOT)/../cocos2d/extensions/cocos2dx-profile/build/ios/headers`
 - `$(SRCROOT)/../cocos2d/extensions/cocos2dx-levelup/Soomla`

1. Make sure you have these 3 Frameworks linked to your XCode project: **Security, libsqlite3.0.dylib, StoreKit**.

1. See the last step of [cocos2dx-profile instructions for iOS](https://github.com/soomla/cocos2dx-profile#instructions-for-ios) in order to connect the Profile module to a social network provider (in this case Facebook).

That's it! Now all you have to do is build your XCode project and run your game with cocos2dx-levelup.

####**Instructions for Android**

1. Import cocos2dx-store, cocos2dx-profile, and cocos2dx-levelup module into your project's Android.mk by adding the following:

    ```
    LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += cocos2dx_store_static # add this line along with your other LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES
    $(call import-module, extensions/cocos2dx-store) # add this line at the end of the file, along with the other import-module calls

    LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += cocos2dx_profile_static # add this line along with your other LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES
    $(call import-module, extensions/cocos2dx-profile) # add this line at the end of the file, along with the other import-module calls

    LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += cocos2dx_levelup_static # add this line along with your other LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES
    $(call import-module, extensions/cocos2dx-levelup) # add this line at the end of the file, along with the other import-module calls
    ```

1. Add the following jars to your android project's classpath:
    - From `extensions/soomla-cocos2dx-core/build/android`
		1. SoomlaAndroidCore.jar
		1. Cocos2dxAndroidCore.jar
		1. square-otto-1.3.2.jar

    - From `extensions/cocos2dx-store/build/android`
		1. AndroidStore.jar
		1. Cocos2dxAndroidStore.jar

    - From `extensions/cocos2dx-profile/build/android`
		1. AndroidProfile.jar
		1. Cocos2dxAndroidProfile.jar

    - From `extensions/cocos2dx-levelup/build/android`
		1. AndroidLevelUp.jar
		1. Cocos2dxAndroidLevelUp.jar

1. Update your `AndroidManifest.xml` to include permissions and the `SoomlaApp`:

    ``` xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />

    <!-- optional: required for uploadImage from SD card -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />

    <application ...
    	       android:name="com.soomla.SoomlaApp">
    	       ...
    </application>
    ```
1. See the last step in [cocos2dx-store instructions for Android](https://github.com/soomla/cocos2dx-store#instructions-for-android) in order to connect the Store module to the desired billing service
1. See the last step in [cocos2dx-profile instructions for Android](https://github.com/soomla/cocos2dx-profile#instructions-for-android) in order to connect the Profile module to a social network provider (in this case Facebook).

That's it! Don't forget to run the **build_native.py** script so cocos2dx-levelup sources will be built with cocos2d-x.

### Integration with SOOMLA cocos2dx-store

Please follow the steps in [cocos2dx-store](https://github.com/soomla/cocos2dx-store) for the _Store_ part of the setup.
Then, you can use the **store-related _LevelUp_ classes**, such as _CCVirtualItemScore_ or _CCVirtualItemReward_ or _CCBalanceGate_.

### Integration with SOOMLA cocos2dx-profile

Please follow the steps in [cocos2dx-profile](https://github.com/soomla/cocos2dx-profile) for the _Profile_ part of the setup.
Then, you can use the **profile-related _LevelUp_ classes**, such as _CCSocialLikeMission_.

## Event Handling

SOOMLA lets you subscribe to levelup events, get notified and implement your own application specific behaviour to them.

> Your behaviour is an addition to the default behaviour implemented by SOOMLA. You don't replace SOOMLA's behaviour.

SOOMLA uses the Cocos2d-x [`EventDispatcher`](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/wiki/EventDispatcher_Mechanism) to dispatch its own custom events.
The names of such events are defined in `CCLevelUpConsts`, the received event has a `__Dictionary` set in its `userData` which holds all the meta-data for the event.
You can subscribe to any event from anywhere in your code.

For example here's how to subscribe to the world completed event:

```cpp
cocos2d::Director::getInstance()->getEventDispatcher()->addCustomEventListener(soomla::CCLevelUpConsts::EVENT_WORLD_COMPLETED, CC_CALLBACK_1(ExampleScene::onWorldCompleted, this));
```

Continuing the example, here's how you would handle and extract data from such an event:

```cpp
void ExampleScene::onWorldCompleted(cocos2d::EventCustom *event) {
  cocos2d::__Dictionary *eventData = (cocos2d::__Dictionary *)event->getUserData();
  soomla::CCWorld *world = dynamic_cast<soomla::CCWorld *>(eventData->objectForKey(soomla::CCLevelUpConsts::DICT_ELEMENT_WORLD));

  // Use world for your needs
}
```

Each event has its own meta-data, see inline documentation in [`CCLevelUpEventDispatcher`](https://github.com/soomla/cocos2dx-levelup/blob/master/Soomla/CCLevelUpEventDispatcher.h) for more information.

## Debugging

You can enable debug logging in cocos2dx-levelup by setting `SOOMLA_DEBUG` in `CCSoomlaUtils.h` (which is located in `soomla-cocos2dx-core` submodule) to `true`. Debug logging can also be enabled at build time by adding `-DSOOMLA_DEBUG=1` to `APP_CPPFLAGS` in your `Application.mk` on Android, or by setting `SOOMLA_DEBUG=1` in your Build Settings' `Preprocessor Macros` on iOS.

If you want to see debug messages from _android-levelup_, set the `logDebug` variable in `com.soomla.SoomlaConfig` to `true`.

To see debug messages on iOS, make sure you have also `DEBUG=1` in your Build Settings' `Preprocessor Macros` (for Debug only).

## Working with sources

**SOOMLA appreciates code contributions!** You are more than welcome to extend the capabilities of cocos2dx-levelup.

NOTE: If you would like to contribute, please follow our [Documentation Guidelines](https://github.com/soomla/cocos2dx-store/blob/master/documentation.md). Clear, consistent comments will make our code easy to understand.

To integrate cocos2dx-levelup into your game, follow these steps:

1. **Recursively** clone soomla-cocos2dx-core, cocos2dx-store, cocos2dx-profile, and cocos2dx-levelup.

    ```
    $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:soomla/soomla-cocos2dx-core.git extensions/soomla-cocos2dx-core

    $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:soomla/cocos2dx-store.git extensions/cocos2dx-store

    $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:soomla/cocos2dx-profile.git extensions/cocos2dx-profile

    $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:soomla/cocos2dx-levelup.git extensions/cocos2dx-levelup
    ```

    **OR:** If you have already cloned the repositories, to obtain submodules, use command:

    ```
    $ git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

    **NOTE:** You should run this command in every repository.

2. For iOS: Use sourced versions of Linked projects:
	1. `extensions/soomla-cocos2dx-core/development/Cocos2dxCoreFromSources.xcodeproj`
	1. `extensions/cocos2dx-store/development/Cocos2dxStoreFromSources.xcodeproj`
	1. `extensions/cocos2dx-profile/development/Cocos2dxProfileFromSources.xcodeproj`
	1. `extensions/cocos2dx-levelup/development/Cocos2dxLevelUpFromSources.xcodeproj`

3. For Android: You can use our "sourced" modules for Android Studio (or IntelliJ IDEA):
	1. `extensions/soomla-cocos2dx-core/development/Cocos2dxCoreFromSources.iml`
	1. `extensions/cocos2dx-store/development/Cocos2dxStoreFromSources.iml`
	1. `extensions/cocos2dx-profile/development/Cocos2dxProfileFromSources.iml`
	1. `extensions/cocos2dx-levelup/development/Cocos2dxLevelUpFromSources.iml`

## How to move from v1.0.x to v1.2.x?

  Version 1.2.x is all about making the integration process on iOS and Android easier.
  If you are using v1.0.x and want to move to v1.2.x follow these steps:

  1. Pull the latest version to your `extensions` folder
  1. Remove any Soomla-related code in iOS (`AppController.mm`) and Android (`Cocos2dxActivity`), especially code related to `ServiceManager` and any other `Service`s.
  1. In your AppDelegate.cpp:
    - Change `soomla::CCServiceManager::getInstance()->setCommonParams(commonParams);` to `soomla::CCSoomla::initialize("customSecret");`
    - Change `soomla::CCStoreService::initShared(assets, storeParams);` to `soomla::CCSoomlaStore::initialize(assets, storeParams);`
    - Change `soomla::CCProfileService::initShared(profileParams);` to `soomla::CCSoomlaProfile::initialize(profileParams);`
    - Remove `soomla::CCLevelUpService::initShared();`
    - Remove any `#include`s to missing header files, you only need `Cocos2dxStore.h`, `Cocos2dxProfile.h` and `Cocos2dxLevelUp.h`
  1. Remove any reference to `EventHandler`s and subscribing through Soomla `EventDispatcher`s, instead use the Cocos2d-x `EventDispatcher` to subscribe to events.

## Example Usages

  > Examples using virtual items are dependent on cocos2dx-store module, with proper `CCSoomlaStore` initialization and `CCStoreAssets` definitions. See the cocos2dx-store integration section for more details.

* CCMission with CCReward (collect 5 stars to get 1 mega star)
